6.  Scroll to the top-right and click the green **"Commit changes..."** button.

### **What Happens Now?**

By saving that change, you have automatically started a new build process.

*   Click on the **"Actions"** tab at the top of your repository.
*   You will see a new workflow running. It should now complete successfully.
*   Once it finishes with a green checkmark, you can click on it and download the **"Sakura-Program"** artifact just like before.

Sorry again for that error, and well done for spotting it! You've just fixed your first build script.
